# AI_ML_Hackathon
In this project, when a photo is clicked, more photographs that match the original image's content are shown. The system must accurately identify the products based on the image. The model must be trained to recognise and detect comparable pictures in order to automatically and reliably select photos that match the original image. Reverse image searches are made simple with the help of our "Search by Image" application. This will aid in identifying bogus information on social media and assist journalists and scholars in confirming the validity of photos. 
Photographers frequently use Search by Image to study how their work is disseminated online, while consumers find it useful for finding comparable goods at lower rates.
